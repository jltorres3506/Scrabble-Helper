# Scrabble-Helper

This app is for those who love to play Scrabble but donâ€™t like doing the math involved with the game, it allows the user to insert a word and it will automatically do all the math calculations needed to determine the score for that particular word, even if there is a double or triple letter score or a double or triple word score. It has also the Bingo option, which when you make a word using all 7 tiles you get 50 points extra.
