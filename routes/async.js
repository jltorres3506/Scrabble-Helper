/********basics
 
by nature js is not asyncrnous but with node it does do that

:none-blocking code means that while the system is waiting for code to run
it can do other things in the meantime

:syncronous code: runs one line at time from top to bottom

:call-stack: is where functions go to get called,
 add function to top and remove a function from top NOTE:
only goes to stack if its a function call not a decleration
